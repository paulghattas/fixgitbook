# OpenShift OperatorHub

OpenShift OperatorHub is the OpenShift cluster graphical interface that OpenShift administrators use to discover, install and upgrade Operators. With one click, these Operators can be installed on the cluster, ready for engineering teams to self-service manage your product in dev, test and prod environments.

After your Operator is approved by Red Hat, it shows up immediately in the OpenShift OperatorHub for all OpenShift admins to discover and install.
