# Operator Developer Guide

## **Introduction**

Red Hat strongly believes that Operators provide the best Day 1 and Day 2 management experience for modern applications. Red Hat’s goal is twofold:

1. Provide a set of tools to build high quality Operators that fulfill the promise of hybrid cloud
2. Provide a discovery and distribution method to connect Red Hat customers with partners that solve the customer’s business problem\(s\) with Operators. Red Hat needs you – as the expert in your arena – to make our customers successful.

This guide will provide you with insight into the user experience that an Operator can provide, best practices for building an Operator, and some of the tools available to help you get up and running quickly with your Operator.
