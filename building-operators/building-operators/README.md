# Building Operators

Any programming language can be used to create an Operator. Red Hat has [produced an SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) that covers most of the scaffolding required to start building an Operator, to save you time and get to market quicker.  


Operators are built and run as containers. They can be plugged into any CI/CD tools or workflows you may already have for containers.
