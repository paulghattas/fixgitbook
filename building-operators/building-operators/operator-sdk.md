# Operator SDK

The Operator SDK is a CLI tool and set of pre-generated code to help you quickly build an Operator that handles install, upgrade, full lifecycle control and more. The SDKâ€™s goal is to require an Operator author to provide the business logic of your application and everything else is handled for you.
