## Using the Operator Framework

The Operator Framework is a family of tools and capabilities to deliver on the customer experience described above. Itâ€™s not just about writing code. Testing, delivery, and updating Operators are just as important. The Framework components consists of open source tools to tackle these problems:

* [**Operator SDK**](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) - build, test and package Operators
* [**Operator Lifecycle Manager**](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) - controls the install/upgrade/RBAC of Operators on a cluster
* [**Operator Metering**](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering) - collecting operational metrics about Operators on the cluster for Day 2 management and aggregating usage metrics

In addition to the Operator Framework, OperatorHub provides an interface for discovering, installing, and managing Operators. There are two flavors of OperatorHub as follows:

* OperatorHub.io - [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/) is a community registry designed to make it easy for Kubernetes owners to find Operator based services. It does not include OpenShift certified Operators.
* OpenShift OperatorHub - A registry of Operators embedded within every OpenShift 4 cluster. This registry includes all community Operators that have been tested with OCP from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/) as well as all OpenShift certified Operators.

As an partner, you can work with Red Hat to ensure that the same set of images are used to publish to both [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/) and OpenShift OperatorHub. It is just that the submission process for each is different, as described later in this document.

All these tools/components are designed to be composable, so you can use any that are useful to you.
